There doesn't appear to be much information on this product,
at least nothing that appears to be reliable as there
doesn't seem to be any known manufacturer.
Various vendor websites say that the device has either a
voltage range of 3.3V-to-5V or only 5V. If the sensor works
at 3.3V then we'll keep it at that voltage, otherwise we'll
need to use 5V.
