Comments, Feedback, Points of Interest:

*Device has a nice appearence
*Device enclosure could be smaller
*No battery is being used (needed 9V for solenoid)
*Main shortcoming: not enough test data (only 20 days)
*Soil moisture sensor only testing extreme values (any rain
will cause sensor values to be max). Could use homemade
sensors to replace current component
*Live data isn't being published for evapotranspiration
values (Only historical values)
*Should test device in varying locations
*Difficult to measure without being crop specific
*Scaling factor is there when using different crops
*Solar radiation is calculated using latitude and the
calander day
*Water is measured via flow sensor to determine how much
water is irrigated
*An initial known state (based on a clay bed) is used to
flood the system when the device is calibrated. Recalibrate
with a flood signal
*Another system uses a total budget for plants that gradually
saves water, but requires more configuration
*The system can record 32 days of data

What's missing?

*Needs more testing

Business:

*Send code (C, SmartBASIC, Android App)
*Take pictures
*A prototype would be nice
*Report (Github documents/wiki, PCB, etc.)
