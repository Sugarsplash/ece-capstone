Have the device compacted as one unit.

Connection of the hose to the actuator should be outside of
our device enclosure.

Might need to use some external battery to power the
actuator if there is no main power line to use.

Run temperature on the inside of case and test with
temperature outside case. Need to determine what kind
of digital thermometer to use if not using the cheap
analog temperture sensor.

Acquire crystal and real-time clock to keep track of time.
Need soil moisture sensors, temperature sensors and
rain drop sensors.

Plan to have design documentation done in next 2 weeks.
Next milestone there should be a prototype.
