Informed advisor, Roy, about:

Finals to Spring break transition
-New breakout board as we needed more I/O (BB600)

-Android functions (scan for device, get info from device)

Spring break to first week of class

Need enclosure design created
-Rubber gasket a possibility for closing/opening
-Wall wort near plug, extension cord into enclosure
-Need a place to mount the rain drop sensor
-Will probably bundle cables to two different holes in
 enclosure, one for power and one for sensors
