			Milestone Meeting

Given to Sandeep: Project Design Specification, System
Design Model, explaination of algorithm in Bryan's logbook,
various research material

Starting conditions - known condition that the field is
already well watered. The algorithm will help with keeping
the field watered in an efficient manner

Latitude, day of the year, daily high/low temperature

How will we come about initial conditions? When will we
recalibrate? If we start at some initial state and
continue on to another state, how might we go back to that
initial state?

Watering field to a known quantity

Reconfigure and recalibrate variables

Determine ideas for coming up with a recalibration algorithm

Precipitation event detection via rain pad sensor

Obtain data locally for humidity to determine irrigation
needs?

How do you make the amount of precipitation know to device?

Sandeep will look into sensor information for next few weeks

Change in requirements: Be re-programmable while deployed
from a SHOULD to a MUST

6 months battery life is good, quartly battery life might
also be acceptable

Auto configuration of device kept as a MAY, but this could
change in the future to be more important

What kind of impact will different types of irrigation
systems have?

We want by the end of February to get a prototype going.
Sandeep wants to see some timeline/milestone information

Team meeting in the near future for generating a more
detailed timeline/milestone list

Sandeep doing field testing on new device that could
potentially be deployed with our algorithm
