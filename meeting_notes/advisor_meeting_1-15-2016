Using Hardgreaves reduced set approximation for
evapotranspiration.

Idea to use a piezoelectric transducer to determine
how frequent water is droping and at what intensity.

If a precipitation event occurs, then we don't water.
We may determine the intensity of the water in. 

The P term in the Hargreaves equation is "nice to have"
but not necessary (set to 0 if we're not looking into
intensity of precipitation).

Solar radiation determined by calendar day and degrees
latitude.

We may be able to autoconfigure the device. The device
will be able to pull data from a mobile device (phone).

Assumed that we use a solid state relay to trigger the
actuator so we don't drive the actuator directly.

Temperature needs need to at least 1 degree resolution
otherwise the delta will be too small.

Brass actuator will handle more pressure but requires
much more energy than the plastic version.

Need to determine the size of the field on initialization.

Need a real time clock to keep track of how much time
has passed (know what day of the year it is).

We'll probably need a fairly rugged temperature sensor.

	Post-Meeting:

Requirements are essentially finished, try and get the
specification finished. Beginning of next week, set up
a meeting with Sandeep and show him our requirements and
specification to make sure everything checks out.

Project notebooks can be physical or electronic. They will
be physically signed up at the end of the term.
