Brass flow meter

Brass solenoid to actuate

Time to water (evening? morning?)

Need to determine: rain event detection

For initialization: date, time, latatude
(given in degrees, convert in radians)

If we have a rain pad to determine precipitation,
we can't have our irrigation system accidentally
spray water on the rain pad.

After meeting resolutions:

1) Figure out how to determine when a rain event occurs.
2) Determine what the water proof case/enclosure will be.
3) Determine power system for our device (if solar panels
are used, need to know how this will effect enclosure).
4) Need to interface with soil moisture sensor when testing
begins (use the sensor data to test our device/algorithm).
