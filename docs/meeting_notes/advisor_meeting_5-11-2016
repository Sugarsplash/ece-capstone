Meeting with Sandeep: Monday at 5pm or Tuesday at 10am
Could be next week so that we're in a more stable state on
tests and the addition on another device for the face-to-face

The app is fully functional. It can send data to and receive
data from the device. Data from the device can be downloaded
for analysis.

Testing comments:

*Device essentially requires a shaded location to produce
accurate ambient temperature data. Might need to redesign
enclosure to provide adequate shade to device
*Soil moisture sensor is only showing extremes, as small
amounts of water to the soil causes readings to skyrocket.
Might need to introduce some scaling factor to ADC
*Need to add a delay for app reading data. At the moment, the
reading cycle is too fast to fully transfer data
